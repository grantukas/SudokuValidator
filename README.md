# Sudoku Validator Program (SVP)

Class project for Chapman CPSC-380 (Operating Systems).

The purpose of this program is to validate a 9x9 completed Sudoku puzzle.
The program accepts a .txt file as input and analyzes the puzzle.
Analysis is done in 3 separate threads, searching through rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids for errors.
The SVP specifies via output where there is an error and what value to replace in that position.
If there is no console output then you have no errors!
